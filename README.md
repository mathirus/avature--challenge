# hp-dev-jobberwocky

You have been asked to implement **Jobberwocky** , a service that works as a store for job opportunities, where companies can share open positions.

## 1. Create a job posting service

Implement an application that exposes an API that lets users register new job opportunities.
- The app does not need to persist info on an external database service.
- Feel free to store jobs in memory or disk (CSV, SQLite,etc).
- Choose any API style: web‐based, REST, GraphQL, etc.

## 2. Create a job searching service

Extend your application to expose another endpoint that lets users find job opportunities from the service you have already created.

## 3. Create additional sources

In addition to our internal job service, we want our job-search service to consume data from additional job opportunity sources. To achieve this, we need to consume [jobberwocky-extra-source](https://github.com/avatureta/jobberwocky-extra-source-v2), which, as you may notice, provides data in a rather messy response format. Find the best way to return a response that combines results from multiple sources.

NOTE: You must not make any changes to the jobberwocky-extra-source project. You should only run the service and consume its data from your Jobberwocky application.

## 4. Create a Job Alerts service (optional)

Update your application so that it lets candidates subscribe to an email address and be notified whenever a new job is posted. An optional search pattern can be provided as a way to filter job posts.
